It's almost ceremonious for every "blog" to begin with some sort of a "first post" which details out what they hope to accomplish from this / why they're starting this in the first place etc, so I guess this is my attempt at that.<br />
I've been wanting to start writing since my Sophomore year, but I've always asked myself what I would write about, whether I would be skilled enough to write it (in high hopes that this would actually reach more than a single pair of eyees :P) and somehow I've never been able to answer those questions.<br /><br />

Thankfully, due to CoVID, I've had more free time on my hand to actually get over the interia and start writing about anything I see fit, and that is what this place is. It's just for me to write about thing that I personally find really really cool, and it probably isn't restricted to the world of tech/software development (Though most of it would be in that domain, because, comeon, isn't it **really cool** how so much in the world runs because of what some grumpy, socially isolated humans wrote behind a computer screen). <br /><br />
Another mention, I am not a formal writer, and (yes, I don't mind oxford commas, bite me); so most of how (and what) I write will be how I hear myself in my head, if that annoys you, you should probably get off this page before I come on your death note.<br /><br />
Also, I really (realllllyyy) like brackets (if you haven't noticed them (I bet you have (_whaaaat_, nested bracketsss????))).<br /><br />

This is all for you, for now!
